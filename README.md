**Tipp** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Paulo Alberto Sousa**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Option to input tip percentage directly in the main page via a text field. The '%' symbol is persistantly added to this field as a suffix for clarity to the user. Inputting a value into here will deselect the segemented control for additional clarity.
- [x] Theme selection added to the settings page that changes the color used in the UI. Theme is also saved throughout app restarts.
- [x] Lite UI work
